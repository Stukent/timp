# timp
A library of React components


This is designed to be consumed by other Stukent projects.

You'll need to add to `package.lock` a line like the folowing
`"timp": "git+ssh://git@github.com:Stukent/timp#<identifier>"

Where `<identifier>` is a commit, branch, or tag.
Make sure the importing project is set up to transpile this code for ES6 and JSX
